# Synthesize-ME

We want to develop a Python package that will perform the following task:

Given

- a path to an input folder of CSV files and
- a path to an empty output folder,

generate synthetic versions of the CSV files in the input folder and write them to disk in the output folder.

We want to give the user of the package the option of fine-tuning certain aspect of the synthetic data generate process.

We will call the package `synthesize_me`.
